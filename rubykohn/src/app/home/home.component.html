    I am a senior at Smith College currently finishing up my B.S. in
    Engineering.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research experience predominantly concerns clean water engineering. I
    have worked as a research assistant in the <a href="http://www.science.smith.edu/ismail/">Ismail Lab </a>at Smith
    college for
    the last two years. This lab utilizes zooplankton as a filter of microbial
    pollutants.
  </p>
  <p>
    My engineering interests arenâ€™t solely related to water. This past summer
    (2018) I had the opportunity to work at the Technical University in
    Darmstadt, Germany on infrastructural engineering related to electric
    vehicles. See my research page for a full list of my research with descriptions, diagrams, and links.
